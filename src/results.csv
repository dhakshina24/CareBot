How do doctors know if someone has acute stress disorder?,"Doctors diagnose acute stress disorder based on a combination of the patient's history and physical examination to rule out other diseases that can cause anxiety. The doctor may ask questions about the patient's symptoms, such as when they started, how long they have lasted, and how they are affecting the patient's daily life. They may also perform a physical examination to check for any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the patient's anxiety. If the patient's symptoms are severe enough to interfere with normal life and have lasted longer than one month, the diagnosis may be changed to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).","Anxiety symptoms connected with acute stress disor-
der include irritability, physical restlessness, sleep prob-
lems, inability to concentrate, and being easily startled.

If you notice any of these signs, call emergency services immediately. In the meantime, administer an EpiPen if you have one available, and provide your child with a antihistamine such as diphenhydramine or chlorpheniramel to help alleviate symptoms.

2. Apply pressure to the injured area with a clean towel to stop the bleeding.
3. Apply antibiotic ointment and a sterile bandage to the wound to help prevent infection and promote healing.

Why is zolpidem (Ambien) not recommended for use on airplane flights shorter than seven to eight hours?,"Zolpidem, commonly known as Ambien, is not recommended for use on airplane flights shorter than seven to eight hours because it can cause drowsiness and impair cognitive function.

Why avoid taking triptans within 24 hours of ergotamine?,"The interaction between triptans (Sumatriptan, Naratriptan, Riza-triptan, and Zolmitriptan) and ergotamine can cause serious problems.

1. Lightheadedness or dizziness: The combination of these two drugs can cause a significant drop in blood pressure, leading to lightheadedness or dizziness.
2. Heart palpitations: The combined effect of the triptans and ergotamine on blood vessels can also cause irregular heartbeats or palpitations.
3. Fainting: With further decreases in blood pressure, there is a risk of fainting or feeling dizzy, especially when standing up suddenly.
4. Other adverse effects: Taking triptans and ergotamine together can also cause other adverse effects such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

block the flow of urine causing pain and difficulty with
urination. They can also scratch the bladder wall, which
may lead to bleeding or infection.
Causes and symptoms
While the exact causes of the formation of bladder
stones are not completely understood, bladder stones
usually occur because of urinary tract infection (UTI),
obstruction of the urinary tract, enlargement of the
prostate gland in men, or the presence of foreign bodies the urinary tract becomes obstructed by the stone. These
symptoms include:
• abnormally dark colored urine
• blood in the urine
• difficulty urinating
• frequent urge to urinate
• lower abdominal pain
• pain or discomfort in the penis
