What is Acne?,"Hello! I'm here to help answer your question. Based on the context provided, acne is a skin condition that occurs when the pores or hair follicles become blocked, causing small swellings to develop on the skin surface. These swellings can become inflamed, leading to the formation of pimples and cysts on the face, neck, shoulders, and upper back. Acne is caused by a combination of factors, including excess oil production, clogged pores, and bacterial infection. Isotretinoin (Accutane) is a prescription medication that is used to treat very severe, disfiguring acne.","GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 25

Acne is a skin condition that occurs when pores or
hair follicles become blocked. This allows a waxy
material, sebum, to collect inside the pores or follicles.
Normally, sebum flows out onto the skin and hair to
form a protective coating, but when it cannot get out,
small swellings develop on the skin surface. Bacteria
and dead skin cells can also collect that can cause
inflammation. Swellings that are small and not KEY TERMS

What are the symptoms of diabetes?,"As a helpful medical assistant, I can answer your question based on the context provided. Type I diabetes mellitus is characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) and fatigue, while amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurological disease that affects muscle function and can cause stumbling, difficulty climbing stairs, and weakness in the hands.
The symptoms of diabetes mellitus include:
1. Frequent urination due to high blood sugar levels
2. Increased thirst and hunger
3. Blurred vision
4. Fatigue
5. Cuts or bruises that are slow to heal
6. Recurring skin, gum, or bladder infections
7. Flu-like symptoms (tiredness, weakness, and dizziness)
8. Numbness or tingling in the hands and feet

The symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis include:
1. Muscle twitching or cramping
2. Difficulty walking or running","• Type I diabetes mellitus. Characterized by fatigue and
an abnormally high level of glucose in the blood

• Amyotrophic lateral schlerosis. First signs are stum-

cramps and twitching may be observed as well as
weakness in the hands making fastening buttons or
turning a key difficult. Speech may become slowed or
slurred. There may also be difficluty swallowing. As
respiratory muscles atrophy, there is increased danger begin to fall. A person with diabetes mellitus either does
not make enough insulin, or makes insulin that does not
work properly. The result is blood sugar that remains
high, a condition called hyperglycemia.
Diabetes must be diagnosed as early as possible. If
left untreated, it can damage or cause failure of the eyes,
kidneys, nerves, heart, blood vessels, and other body
organs. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, may also be
discovered through blood sugar testing. Hypoglycemia is Resources

What causes high blood pressure?,"High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, can be caused by a variety of factors. Here are some of the main causes:
1. Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries): Over time, the inner lining of your blood vessels can become less flexible and more prone to buildup of plaque, which can narrow the passages and increase blood pressure.
2. Poor diet: Consuming foods that are high in sodium, processed meats, and added sugars can contribute to high blood pressure.
3. Lack of physical activity: Not getting enough exercise or being overweight or obese can increase your risk of developing hypertension.
4. Smoking: Smoking can damage the inner lining of your blood vessels, leading to hypertension and increasing the risk of heart disease.
5. Stress: Chronic stress can increase your blood pressure and contribute to other health problems.
6. Sleep apnea: This condition, in which a person stops breathing for short periods during sleep, can lead to high blood pressure and other health issues.
7. Underlying medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as kidney disease, ad","(BPH), a condition that affects men and is characterized
by an enlarged prostate gland.
High blood pressure
High blood pressure puts a strain on the heart and
the arteries. Over time, hypertension can damage the
blood vessels to the point of causing stroke, heart fail-
ure or kidney failure. People with high blood pressure
may also be at higher risk for heart attacks. Controlling
high blood pressure makes these problems less likely.
Alpha blockers help lower blood pressure by causing health problems that high blood pressure can cause,
patients may have to take medicine for the rest of their
lives. Furthermore, medicine alone may not be enough.
Patients with high blood pressure may also need to avoid
certain foods and keep their weight under control. The
health care professional who is treating the condition can
offer advice on what measures may be necessary.
Patients being treated for high blood pressure should not
change their diets without consulting their physicians. heart and lungs.

How is asthma diagnosed?,"Based on the context provided, asthma can be diagnosed through various methods, including:
1. Skin prick test or blood test: These tests can determine if a person has an allergic reaction to certain allergens, which may contribute to asthma.
2. Spirometry: This involves measuring how much air a person can exhale from their lungs and can help detect any narrowing of the airways.
3. Methacholine challenge test: This test involves inhaling a small amount of methacholine, which can cause airway constriction in people with asthma. The test can help determine the severity of asthma and the effectiveness of treatment.","patients, and they may sometimes be the sole cause of

that the allergen being tested is causing the asthma. Also,
the body’s immune system produces antibody to fight off
the allergen, and the amount of antibody can be mea-

patient is to a particular allergen. If the diagnosis is still
in doubt, the patient can inhale a suspect allergen while

What are the early signs of Alzheimer’s disease?,"Based on the provided context, the early signs of Alzheimer's disease include:
* Memory loss that affects job skills or daily activities
* Difficulty performing familiar tasks, such as cooking or managing finances
* Problems with language, including trouble finding the right words or understanding what others are saying
* Disorientation of time and place, such as forgetting the date or where they are
* Poor or decreased judgment, leading to risky behavior or decisions
* Difficulty with abstract thinking, such as problem-solving or decision-making
* Misplacing things, including valuables or important documents.","severe problems with eating, communicating, and con-
trolling their bladder and bowel functions.
The Alzheimer’s Association has developed a list of ten
warning signs of AD. A person with several of these symp-
toms should see a physician for a thorough evaluation:
• memory loss that affects job skills
• difficulty performing familiar tasks
• problems with language
• disorientation of time and place
• poor or decreased judgment
• problems with abstract thinking
• misplacing things Causes
The cause or causes of Alzheimer’s disease are
unknown. Some strong leads have been found through
recent research, however, and these have also given some
theoretical support to several new experimental treatments.
